Piranesi by Susanna Clarke felt like a profound exploration of symbolism, storytelling, and the fragility of knowledge. The House initially felt real, but over time, it revealed itself as a metaphor—possibly for amnesia, the human mind, or the distillation of human knowledge. The tides and water symbolized the fragility of this knowledge, and Piranesi’s role as a curator highlighted the need for care and reverence in preserving it.

The statues in the House added another layer of symbolism. They might represent perfect versions of humans in the real world, just as they depict perfect forms of real-world objects. This interpretation could extend to Piranesi himself, whose childlike curiosity and meticulous nature felt like an aspirational ideal, and even to Ketterley, representing distorted aspects of humanity.

The novel also evokes Carl Jung’s ideas. The House can be seen as a representation of the collective unconscious—a vast, shared reservoir of human knowledge, experiences, and archetypes. The statues may symbolize Jungian archetypes, universal patterns embedded in the human psyche. Piranesi’s journey mirrors Jung’s process of individuation: the integration of conscious and unconscious parts of the self to achieve wholeness. His reverence and curiosity reflect an archetypal "Seeker" on a path of self-discovery.

Additionally, the duality of Ketterley and Piranesi echoes Jung’s concept of the Shadow—the darker, hidden side of ourselves that must be confronted. The House’s dreamlike, timeless quality further enhances its connection to Jungian ideas, resembling the symbolic landscapes of dreams and the unconscious mind.

Piranesi’s reverence for the House and his eventual escape elevated his relationship with it, as he used his experiences to better understand the real world. However, his repeated returns showed his enduring connection—perhaps even a surrender to the House’s power, depicted through the statues and tides. This surrender felt poignant, as Piranesi seemed broken, finding more peace and tranquility in the House than in the real world.

The story also raised profound questions about how modern society treats knowledge and memory, critiquing the loss of reverence for them. The House seemed to parallel our own world and mind, illustrating their power over our conscience. Piranesi’s intentional avoidance of uncomfortable truths about his identity mirrored universal human tendencies to protect inner peace, highlighting his humanity.

Personally, Piranesi inspired reflections on my identity as a curator and my fascination with knowledge. While I admired Piranesi’s meticulous care, it also made me question my own approach to preserving knowledge, as I often tell myself I’ll become more organized “someday.” The book’s themes of reverence, curiosity, and the fragility of knowledge resonate deeply and serve as a reminder of the responsibility we have as curators of our own lives.
