Having immersed myself in 28 Years Later, I found it to be a film brimming with ambitious ideas and moments of genuine thought-provocation, yet ultimately hampered by an overarching inconsistency that diminished its overall impact. While the performances of the human actors were largely commendable, and certain thematic explorations resonated deeply, the film often struggled to cohere its disparate parts into a unified whole.

One of the film's most compelling, and arguably most successful, aspects was its exploration of how human nature might evolve in the face of prolonged apocalypse. The isolated community on Lindisfarne, with its reversion to medieval customs, hierarchical structures, and reliance on ancient technologies like bows and ballistas, was fascinating. Observing their daily lives, the education of children, and the coming-of-age rituals genuinely prompted reflection on how easily our modern societal norms, built on a foundation of taken-for-granted civilization and technology, could unravel. These elements offered a poignant commentary on humanity's adaptability and perhaps an uncomfortable look at our not-so-distant past.

However, this very strength was often undermined by jarring execution. The explicit intercuts to historical medieval scenes, while perhaps intended to underscore the societal regression, felt redundant and pulled me out of the immersive world the film was building. The narrative, too, often felt constrained by its tight focus on Spike's immediate family, leaving the "rich tapestry of the human condition" within the Lindisfarne community largely unexplored — a missed opportunity to truly deepen the social commentary.

A significant source of my disconnect stemmed from the film's aesthetic and sonic choices. The soundtrack, with its pronounced electronic and hip-hop influences from Young Fathers, often struck me as anachronistic. While the previous films leveraged orchestral and post-rock scores to evoke visceral dread and melancholy, this new sound felt jarringly modern against the medieval backdrop of Lindisfarne. It was as if the film itself hadn't quite decided whether it was embracing the past or fully grounding itself in the contemporary, leading to a noticeable discord that frequently broke my immersion. Had the film woven in scenes of the islanders repurposing old electronic equipment for new music, or presented their fragmented memories of contemporary sounds through their rituals, this sonic disconnect might have felt more intentional and less jarring.

Furthermore, the portrayal of the infected themselves contributed to this inconsistency. While I was open to the concept of the Rage virus evolving over 28 years, the visual design of the "obese" infected, with their unconvincing makeup, felt less menacing and more distracting. Similarly, while the "alpha" infected were conceptually menacing, their gratuitous nudity often tipped into the absurd, further breaking the grim immersion crucial for such a film. The "acting" of the infected extras, too, lacked the terrifying conviction of previous installments, making the central threat feel less potent.

The introduction of the uninfected baby born to infected parents served as a prime example of the film prioritizing future sequels over immediate narrative integrity. This plot device felt contrived, forcing an urgent timeline that regrettably rushed Isla's poignant euthanasia scene. A moment demanding space for emotional depth and Spike's acceptance was instead hurried, diminishing its impact for the sake of setting up the next installment. This "sequel bait" approach felt like a disservice to the present story.

This issue of narrative contrivance also extended to Spike's journey. While his desperation to save his mother was well-established, his sudden, seemingly inexplicable courage to venture alone into a perilous mainland after a terrifying previous encounter stretched the bounds of believability. A companion, a "fellowship of the ring" dynamic, would have significantly bolstered the plausibility of his actions, making his desperate love feel more earned within the narrative.

The film's ending, revealing a Jimmy Savile-inspired cult clad in colorful, almost Teletubby or Power Ranger-esque jumpsuits, cemented the feeling of inconsistency. This radical tonal shift, from a grim and emotional survival narrative to a bizarre, almost cartoonish (yet menacing) cult, left a poor taste and retroactively diminished the film's preceding strengths. While perhaps intended as a provocative setup for the sequel, it felt like a desperate grab for shock value that severely undermined the film's established tone.

**Dr. Kelson: A Compelling Enigma Untethered**

Among the film's most intriguing characters was Dr. Kelson, compellingly portrayed by Ralph Fiennes. Initially presented as a potentially monstrous or deranged figure, Kelson's arc subtly revealed him to be a deeply human and empathetic individual. His medical background provided a fascinating lens through which to view his unique, controversial method of coexisting with the infected alphas, rather than simply eradicating them. One could interpret this as his adherence to the Hippocratic Oath, viewing the infected not merely as monsters, but as tragic victims of a disease, deserving of study or even a form of management. This novel approach to the central threat was a genuinely thought-provoking addition to the franchise's lore.

However, Kelson's screen time was frustratingly limited, leaving many vital questions unanswered. Despite his seemingly vast knowledge of the altered world, he never commented on the Lindisfarne community, nor did the film explain why he knowingly put himself in jeopardy by keeping the alphas alive without a clear, stated purpose. Furthermore, the practical inconsistencies of his prolonged isolation were glaring; with his obviously visible signal fire, it strains credulity that he hadn't encountered other survivors or, crucially, the newly introduced Jimmies cult. He felt less like a fully integrated character and more like a conceptual placeholder for future narratives. While his "magpie-like curation" of salvaged objects wonderfully highlighted humanity's natural drive to preserve memory and culture, Kelson ultimately remained an enigma whose potential for deeper exploration was regrettably squandered in this installment.

**Deeper Allegorical Layers: A Raging Island's Reflection**

Despite these significant inconsistencies, 28 Years Later truly shone in its deeper allegorical layers. The explicit portrayal of Britain as an isolated island, completely cut off from the rest of Europe, with Swedish soldiers confirming that "things were normal back home," served as a powerful, thinly veiled allusion to Brexit and the apathy of the external world. It painted a stark picture of a nation grappling with the extreme consequences of its own isolation, while the world looks on with detached indifference, a grim commentary on contemporary global disengagement and the self-inflicted wounds of nationalistic fervour.

In this context, the Rage virus itself transcends its role as a mere biological threat. It becomes a chilling allegory for ideology and memetics — how collective thought can be infected and taken over by primal, irrational emotions like rage, leading to disastrous, self-destructive consequences. This interpretation, with its unsettling parallels to the divisive rhetoric and viral spread of ideas that fueled events like Brexit, elevates the film's horror beyond the literal infected. This thematic depth is perhaps the franchise's most enduring legacy, building upon the original film's exploration of inherent human aggression and 28 Weeks Later's focus on institutional failure.

Ultimately, 28 Years Later is a film of stark contrasts. Its commendable ambition to explore complex themes and push the franchise forward is undeniable. However, its execution often falters, resulting in a viewing experience that, while intermittently thought-provoking, is marred by jarring tonal shifts, questionable design choices, and narrative contrivances that, for me, regrettably diminished its overall impact. It leaves a lingering impression of what could have been a truly great and cohesive continuation.
