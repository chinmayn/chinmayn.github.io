I'm a Senior Product Manager at Amazon, working on making search on Amazon more helpful to customers through Q&A content. Currently, I'm using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful content about products that can support purchasing decisions.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Product Manager at Amazon Web Services in Training & Certification, where I built interactive learning products to help AWS customers onboard onto AWS services more effectively.

Prior to AWS, I worked at Applied Materials as a product manager in EdTech. Before embarking on a tech career, I completed my PhD at Stanford University working on energy materials for solar cells and hydrogen storage applications. 

In my spare time, I like to read, keep up with the latest in AI, listen to new music.

I write about things that fascinate me â€” from deep dives into technology and product strategy to essays on the stories and ideas that shape our culture.
